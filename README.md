# Coursera-DiscreteOptimization
My solutions and attempts on the problems presented in the Coursera - Discrete Optimization course.

Disclaimer:
- The algorithms follow the courses' predetermined input and output format, which is described in the assignment files; 
- The code is (as far as I remember) mostly commented in English, although some comments in Portuguese may show up in some files;
- I made the codes just for myself, therefore some parts may be more messy than I would like;
